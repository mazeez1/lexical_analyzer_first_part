Another project I did in my final year as undergrad at University.

1.	Open a terminal window in the project folder

2.	To compile type in the command line 
		
		make

make executes the written commands in the Makefile, it will compile all the code for you, visit https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile

3.	To execute the program type in the command line
		
		./lex.exe 
		
		and then leave an empty space and type
		
		< sample.in 
		
this will load on the standard input flow all the sample.in file, visit https://www.lifewire.com/redirection-operator-2625979

4. In case you want to compile manual, i recomend you https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiling-with-g-plus-plus/ is explained step by step
